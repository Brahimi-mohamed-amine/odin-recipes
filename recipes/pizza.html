    <h2>Description of the Recipe</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to
      rise.<br />
      You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to
      go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>
      You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super
      simple
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Yeast</strong>Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means
        it's the ingredient that causes<br />
        the pizza dough to rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar</strong>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it
        in warm water with a teaspoon<br />
        of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up
        the<br />
        activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes
        bubbly and <br />
        frothy on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Bread Flour</strong>Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust
        becauseit creates chewier results than all-<br />
        purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps
        produce lots<br />
        of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Olive Oil</strong>Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it
        <br />
        comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it
        creates a barrier between the oil <br />
        and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salt</strong>A little bit of salt goes a long way.<br />
        Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and
        slows down<br />
        fermentation (resulting in a better rise).
      </li>
    </ul>
